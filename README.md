# 🚀 Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
- Detect fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.
- Preprocessing includes handling imbalance, scaling, and cleaning.
- Multiple algorithms are tested and evaluated for best performance.

---

## 📊 Model Workflow
1. Import dataset  
2. Data preprocessing (scaling, handling imbalance with SMOTE/undersampling)  
3. Train-test split  
4. Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Evaluation and visualization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
